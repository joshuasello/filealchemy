Cobra is the common name of various elapid snakes, most of which belonging to the genus Naja.[1]

Biology
All of the known cobras are venomous and many are capable of rearing upwards and producing a hood when threatened.[2]

Known cobras
All members of the genus Naja, the "true" cobras, rear and produce hoods.

Other "cobra" genera and species are as follows:

The rinkhals, or ring-necked spitting cobra, Hemachatus haemachatus, so called for its neck band as well as its habit of rearing and spreading its hood when disturbed[3]
The king cobra, Ophiophagus hannah[4]
The two species of tree cobra, Goldie's tree cobra and black tree cobra[5]
The two species of shieldnose cobras, cape coral snake and Aspidelaps scutatus[5]:p.76
The two species of black desert cobra, desert black snake and Walterinnesia morgani, neither of which rears or produces a hood[5]:p.65
The so-called American cobra, the Eastern coral snake, which also does not rear or produce a hood[5]:p.30
The false water cobra, Hydrodynastes gigas, is the only "cobra" that is not a member of the Elapidae. It does not rear, produces only a slight flattening of the neck, and is only mildly venomous.[5]:p.53

Notes
 Wikisource Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Cobra". Encyclopædia Britannica. 6 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 613.
 Two non-venomous species of snake, the hognose snake and the striped keelback, also rear and produce hoods but are not considered "cobras"; likewise, some venomous elapid snakes such as the black mamba are also capable of producing hoods but are not called "cobras".
